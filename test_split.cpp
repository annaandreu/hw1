CSCI 104: Homework 1 Problem 1

Use this file to test your split.cpp file.

Create linked lists and split them with your split() function.

You can compile this file like this:
g++ split.cpp test_split.cpp -o test_split
*/

#include "split.h"
//#include <iostream>
//using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  return 0;
/*
  // initialize your in nodes 
  Node* five = new Node(5, nullptr);
  Node* four = new Node(4, five);
  Node* three = new Node(3, four);
  Node* two = new Node(2, three);
  Node* one = new Node(1, two);

// You may assume that odds and evens are both NULL when split is called 
  Node* odds = nullptr; 
  Node* evens = nullptr;

split(one, odds, evens);

//print lists 
  while (evens != nullptr){
    cout << evens-> value << " ";
    evens= evens -> next;

  cout << endl; 

  while (odds != nullptr){
    cout << odds-> value << " ";
    odds= odds -> next;

  cout << endl; 


// delete memory
  delete five; 
  delete four;
